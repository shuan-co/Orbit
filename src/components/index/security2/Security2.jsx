            <h2>2 Factor Authentication</h2>
            <p>
              Orbit's security is robust and fortified by the implementation of
              Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which ensures an additional layer
              of protection by requiring users to verify their identity through
              a second authentication factor. This added security measure is
              applied not only during login but also for crucial actions such as
              changing settings, ensuring a secure and trusted user experience.
