IMPORTANT NOTICE: External Navigation Functionality Accessible via Escape Key

We would like to inform you that the External Navigation feature can be accessed within the chat space and reels section of the website by pressing the Escape key.

This website has been meticulously designed to provide our valued clients with a comprehensive feel and overview of the website's design and interconnectivity between various features. However, it is important to note that the current output serves as a prototype and will undergo further improvements during the backend development phase. These enhancements will focus on enhancing interactability and introducing additional frontend features that align with our robust backend capabilities. Notably, we will be incorporating features such as customizability of the home page and the website itself to ensure a tailored user experience.

Furthermore, advanced functionalities like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) will be accompanied by dedicated frontend designs once the backend implementation is completed.

Rest assured, our team is fully committed to refining and perfecting the website to deliver an exceptional user experience. We appreciate your understanding as we work diligently to create a seamless and professional end product. Thank you for your continued support.
